# What is ImguBot ?
ImguBot is a bot made for uploading images to [imgur](https://imgur.com). It can be usefull for servers that needs to upload many images quickly like an anti-raid service. It is simply to use and handle sanding attachments images.

It's also free to use and no commands are requiring paid features. Feel free to use it and share it !

# Features
Actually, there is only a single feature in this bot, and it's the upload command, it upload an image to imgur.

Manay new features are incoming so stay here and star the repository if you want news from the bot.

If you want to create your own feature or command, feel free to fork my work and make a pull request :D

# Can I host my own instance of the bot ?
Sure, i only ask you to credit me and to keep your repository public and forked of mine. I also ask you to do no edit the embed field `line 15 of info.js` that says `.addField("ImguBot code by Ichii#5999", "Original bot code was made by Ichii#5999, you can find it here at the [ImguBot Repository](https://github.com/IchiiSama/ImguBot)")` if you edit or delete this line or the info.js, i will ask you to rewrite it. If you accidently deleted it, i can send you the original file on demand by DM.
