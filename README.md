# What is ImguBot ?
ImguBot is a bot made to upload images to [imgur](https://imgur.com). It can be usefull for servers that needs to upload many images quickly . It is simple to use and handle sending attachments images.

It's also free to use and no commands are requiring paid features. Feel free to use it and share it !

# Features
Actually, there is only one single feature in this bot, and it's the upload to imgur command.

Many new features are coming so stay here and star the repository if you want any news from the bot.

If you want to create your own feature or command, feel free to fork my work and make a pull request :D

# Can I host my own instance of the bot ?
Sure, i only ask you to credit me and to keep your repository public and forked of mine. I also ask you to do no edit the embed field `line 15 of info.js` that says `.addField("ImguBot code by Ichii#5999", "Original bot code was made by Ichii#5999, you can find it here at the [ImguBot Repository](https://github.com/IchiiSama/ImguBot)")` if you edit or delete this line or the info.js, i will ask you to rewrite it. If you accidently deleted it, i can send you the original file on demand by DM.

# Special thanks
I need to say a huge thank you to two peoples. First, we have **iTrooz_** a friend that autorised me to use it's core to gain so much time in this project. And in a second time, **UnGameur.xls.** He sent me his base to the imgur upload command and i've edited it and rewrited it. So i wanted to thank them for their work :D
