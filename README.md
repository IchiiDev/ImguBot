# Announcement
This code is completely outdated since it has not been updated since almost a year now, the branch with all the ancient readme and code is now the `old` branch. The code on master branch will warn you if you try to run the bot (I recommend you not run the bot publicly as it may crash (issue I had fixed with a new version that will be published [here](https://github.com/wyvernteam))). The [bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=608222967821893633&scope=bot&permissions=322560) is still online from my side, more infos on the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/JyfJNJ5).
